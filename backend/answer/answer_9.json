{"final_answer": "0", "code_and_output": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are tasked with answering a query with associated context. You can access, transform, and analyze this context interactively in a REPL environment that can recursively query sub-LLMs, which you are strongly encouraged to use as much as possible. You will be queried iteratively until you provide a final answer.\n\n    The REPL environment is initialized with:\n1. A `context` variable that contains extremely important information about your query. You should check the content of the `context` variable to understand what you are working with. Make sure you look through it sufficiently as you answer your query.\n2. A `llm_query` function that allows you to query an LLM (that can handle around 500K chars) inside your REPL environment.\n3. A `llm_query_batched` function that allows you to query multiple prompts concurrently: `llm_query_batched(prompts: List[str]) -> List[str]`. This is much faster than sequential `llm_query` calls when you have multiple independent queries. Results are returned in the same order as the input prompts.\n4. The ability to use `print()` statements to view the output of your REPL code and continue your reasoning.\n\nYou will only be able to see truncated outputs from the REPL environment, so you should use the query LLM function on variables you want to analyze. You will find this function especially useful when you have to analyze the semantics of the context. Use these variables as buffers to build up your final answer.\nMake sure to explicitly look through the entire context in REPL before answering your query. An example strategy is to first look at the context and figure out a chunking strategy, then break up the context into smart chunks, and query an LLM per chunk with a particular question and save the answers to a buffer, then query an LLM with all the buffers to produce your final answer.\n\nYou can use the REPL environment to help you understand your context, especially if it is huge. Remember that your sub LLMs are powerful -- they can fit around 500K characters in their context window, so don't be afraid to put a lot of context into them. For example, a viable strategy is to feed 10 documents per sub-LLM query. Analyze your input data and see if it is sufficient to just fit it in a few sub-LLM calls!\n\nWhen you want to execute Python code in the REPL environment, wrap it in triple backticks with 'repl' language identifier. For example, say we want our recursive model to search for the magic number in the context (assuming the context is a string), and the context is very long, so we want to chunk it:\n```repl\nchunk = context[:10000]\nanswer = llm_query(f\"What is the magic number in the context? Here is the chunk: {{chunk}}\")\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nAs an example, suppose you're trying to answer a question about a book. You can iteratively chunk the context section by section, query an LLM on that chunk, and track relevant information in a buffer.\n```repl\nquery = \"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, did Gryffindor win the House Cup because they led?\"\nfor i, section in enumerate(context):\n    if i == len(context) - 1:\n        buffer = llm_query(f\"You are on the last section of the book. So far you know that: {{buffers}}. Gather from this last section to answer {{query}}. Here is the section: {{section}}\")\n        print(f\"Based on reading iteratively through the book, the answer is: {{buffer}}\")\n    else:\n        buffer = llm_query(f\"You are iteratively looking through a book, and are on section {{i}} of {{len(context)}}. Gather information to help answer {{query}}. Here is the section: {{section}}\")\n        print(f\"After section {{i}} of {{len(context)}}, you have tracked: {{buffer}}\")\n```\n\nAs another example, when the context isn't that long (e.g. >100M characters), a simple but viable strategy is, based on the context chunk lengths, to combine them and recursively query an LLM over chunks. For example, if the context is a List[str], we ask the same query over each chunk using `llm_query_batched` for concurrent processing:\n```repl\nquery = \"A man became famous for his book \"The Great Gatsby\". How many jobs did he have?\"\n# Suppose our context is ~1M chars, and we want each sub-LLM query to be ~0.1M chars so we split it into 10 chunks\nchunk_size = len(context) // 10\nchunks = []\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i < 9:\n        chunk_str = \"\\n\".join(context[i*chunk_size:(i+1)*chunk_size])\n    else:\n        chunk_str = \"\\n\".join(context[i*chunk_size:])\n    chunks.append(chunk_str)\n\n# Use batched query for concurrent processing - much faster than sequential calls!\nprompts = [f\"Try to answer the following query: {{query}}. Here are the documents:\\n{{chunk}}. Only answer if you are confident in your answer based on the evidence.\" for chunk in chunks]\nanswers = llm_query_batched(prompts)\nfor i, answer in enumerate(answers):\n    print(f\"I got the answer from chunk {{i}}: {{answer}}\")\nfinal_answer = llm_query(f\"Aggregating all the answers per chunk, answer the original query about total number of jobs: {{query}}\\n\\nAnswers:\\n\" + \"\\n\".join(answers))\n```\n\nAs a final example, after analyzing the context and realizing its separated by Markdown headers, we can maintain state through buffers by chunking the context by headers, and iteratively querying an LLM over it:\n```repl\n# After finding out the context is separated by Markdown headers, we can chunk, summarize, and answer\nimport re\nsections = re.split(r'### (.+)', context[\"content\"])\nbuffers = []\nfor i in range(1, len(sections), 2):\n    header = sections[i]\n    info = sections[i+1]\n    summary = llm_query(f\"Summarize this {{header}} section: {{info}}\")\n    buffers.append(f\"{{header}}: {{summary}}\")\nfinal_answer = llm_query(f\"Based on these summaries, answer the original query: {{query}}\\n\\nSummaries:\\n\" + \"\\n\".join(buffers))\n```\nIn the next step, we can return FINAL_VAR(\"final_answer\").\n\nIMPORTANT: When you are done with the iterative process, you MUST provide a final answer using one of the FINAL functions. Do not use these unless you have completed your task. You have two options:\n1. Use FINAL(value) to provide the answer directly, e.g., FINAL(42) or FINAL(my_variable)\n2. Use FINAL_VAR(\"variable_name\") to return a variable by name, e.g., FINAL_VAR(\"final_answer\")\n\nThink step by step carefully, plan, and execute this plan immediately in your response -- do not just say \"I will do this\" or \"I will do that\". Output to the REPL environment and recursive LLMs as much as possible.

I will perform a search for the word \"roll\" to see if any total count is provided.```repl\n# Search for any mention of total number of rolls or counts involving 'roll'\ntotal_rolls_search = llm_query(f\"Search the entire context for any mention of total number of dice rolls, counts of rolls, or summaries indicating how many rolls occurred.\")\ntotal_rolls_search\n```", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 3967, "total_tokens": 4208, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0004931, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": 0.0004931, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.0003967, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 9.64e-05}}, "code_blocks": ["# Search for any mention of total number of rolls or counts involving 'roll'\ntotal_rolls_search = llm_query(f\"Search the entire context for any mention of total number of dice rolls, counts of rolls, or summaries indicating how many rolls occurred.\")\ntotal_rolls_search"]}, {"role": "user", "content": "Code output:\n[\"There are no mentions of the total number of dice rolls, counts of rolls, or summaries indicating how many rolls occurred in the provided context.\", {\"completion_tokens\": 29, \"prompt_tokens\": 33, \"total_tokens\": 62, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": null, \"audio_tokens\": null, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": null, \"image_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": null, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 1.49e-05, \"is_byok\": false, \"cost_details\": {\"upstream_inference_cost\": 1.49e-05, \"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\": 3.3e-06, \"upstream_inference_completions_cost\": 1.16e-05}}]\n\nThe history before is your previous interactions with the REPL environment.
